Step 1
In a large bowl, whisk yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, garam masala, ginger, salt, and Kashmiri chili powder. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.

Heat broiler and line a large baking sheet with foil. Spread chicken on prepared sheet in a single layer. Broil, watching closely, until charred and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Let cool slightly.
MAKHANI SAUCE & ASSEMBLY

Step 1
In a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened, about 5 minutes. Add chile and ginger and continue to cook, stirring, until fragrant and tomato paste is starting to stick to pan, about 1 minute more.
Step 2
Add garam masala, cumin, and chili powder and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant and incorporated, about 30 seconds. Stir in cream, fenugreek (if using), 1/2 teaspoon salt, chicken, and 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce has slightly thickened and fat has separated, 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 3
Taste and season with salt, if needed. Top with cilantro. Serve over rice.
